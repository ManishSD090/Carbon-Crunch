CarbonCrunch is a frontend web project designed to assist businesses and individuals in tracking, minimizing, and reporting carbon emissions. The platform follows GHG (Greenhouse Gas) Accounting principles and covers Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 emissions.

- Responsiveness: A fully responsive layout to ensure seamless use across devices.  
- Interactivity: JavaScript-driven interactivity, such as a collapsible menu for mobile users.  
- Modular Structure: A well-organized file structure to separate concerns (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).  

Technologies Used 
- HTML5: For structuring the webpage content.  
- CSS3: For styling, animations, and responsive design.  
- JavaScript (Vanilla JS): For adding interactivity (e.g., toggling the mobile menu).  

Additional Assets
